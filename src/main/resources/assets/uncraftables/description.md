What does this mod do?
==================
Wither skulls are hard to get and a Wither fight is even harder, so I thought why not dabble in minecraft mods for a moment here? But I'm a big fan of balancing, so it is still hard in my opinion even with this mod. If not make it hard, we may just play in Creative mode, right?

The first recipe lets you turn a skeleton skull into a wither skull by adding some coal and black concrete powder to it and making it stick with honey or slime. Nobody will notice the difference! That way, you can effectively farm skeletons instead of wither skeletons which are more common and even have spawners. This mod does not increase the drop chance for the skulls, though.

In case collecting skeleton skulls or fighting the wither is still too much work, there is a possibility to craft a nether star, but this is designed as end game content, so the ingredients are a bit extraordinary. You will need... *checks notes* ah, yes, several things! Take a ghast tear, put it into a phantom membrane and then fill that with dragon breath. This is the core of our star. Now add a block of diamonds and a block of emeralds for shinyness, blue ice for transparency, a prismarine shard for form, a netherine ingot for sturdyness and a block of honey or slime to keep it all together. Tadaa, new nether star! For convenience's sake (and because I didn't want to add a new item) you can complete both steps at once. For inconvenience's sake the crafting is not shapeless because I want the dragon breath to be in the middle.

Modpacks
==================
Go ahead, just list me as author of this mod in your mod list (CC-BY-4.0 license and all that). If you want to give me extra pleasure, notify me in the comments if you included this mod in your modpack.

Ports
==================
I will do no forge ports, but come on, these are just crafting recipes! This is basically the easiest modding you can do! Try it! (And if you copy my recipes, it would be very nice of you to name me as the one with the initial recipe idea. I took some time thinking of it, after all!)
But if you want a fabric port to older versions, I might do it if you ask me to in the comments; suggestions for the netherite ingot replacements for version 14 and 15 are welcome.
