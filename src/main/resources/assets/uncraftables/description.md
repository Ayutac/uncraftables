What does this mod do?
==================
A lot of Vanilla Minecraft items are uncraftable and some of them can only obtained via grinding or luck or once. I want to change this, but I'm a big fan of balancing, so these items are still hard in my opinion, even with this mod. If not make it hard, we may just play in Creative mode, right?

The first recipe lets you turn a skeleton skull into a wither skull by adding some coal and black concrete powder to it and making it stick with honey or slime. Nobody will notice the difference! That way, you can effectively farm skeletons instead of wither skeletons which are more common and even have spawners. This mod does not increase the drop chance for the skulls, though.

In case collecting skeleton skulls or fighting the wither is still too much work, there is a possibility to craft a nether star, but this is designed as end game content, so the ingredients are a bit extraordinary. You will need... *checks notes* ah, yes, several things! Take a ghast tear, put it into a phantom membrane and then fill that with dragon breath. This is the core of our star. Now add a block of diamonds and a block of emeralds for shinyness, blue ice for transparency, a prismarine shard for form, a netherine ingot for sturdyness and a block of honey or slime to keep it all together. Tadaa, new nether star! For convenience's sake (and because I didn't want to add a new item) you can complete both steps at once. For inconvenience's sake the crafting is not shapeless because I want the dragon breath to be in the middle.

Tridents are really easy to make by comparison if you are bleeding diamonds and have bested some guardians. Just take a long stick, wrap it with prismarine and diamonds and add some sharp prismarine crystals on top of it. Easy, right?

Gilded blackstone is a new fancy stone I haven't encountered yet and I'm sure it is not too hard to get in a bastion. But I found out if you use lava mixed with ghast tears to melt a large amount of netherine and gold over cracked blackstone, it will turn out just the same. Don't ask me how, metallurgy is a dwarf's area of expertise!

Elytras are really easy to craft though. Why has no one else figured that out yet? Just strap some phantom membrane on some end rods and add a nether star for good measure and off we go!

A dragon head is fun to craft! The end crystal is the eyes, the prismarine shard the horns, and the nose is gilded blackstone! (The dragon has a cold, you know, don't judge him. Oh, now you made him cry!) Of course the dragon's mouth is full of his breath and fire.

While the head is more or less severed and, well, dead, the dragon egg is something else! Mainly alive. So after we built the shell out of netherite, gilded blackstone and crying obsidian, we add a dragon head (the DNA), it's breath (the essence), a nether star (the soul) and an elytra (the fly).

And since evolution exists, how about we make the spawn of the ender dragon we defeated (currently inside the dragon egg) into a fish? 'cause believe me, I hate that [explicit] dragon! First try on it and I lost my best tinker armor ever! I will never forgive and never forget! So now we put fish stuff into the dragon egg and make it a fish egg! Justice! (You can view the heart of the sea ether as the new heart or new eye of this elder guardian.)

Go ahead, just list me as author of this mod in your mod list (CC-BY-4.0 license and all that). If you want to give me extra pleasure, notify me in the comments if you included this mod in your modpack.

Ports
==================
I will do no forge ports, but come on, these are just crafting recipes! This is basically the easiest modding you can do! Try it! (And if you copy my recipes, it would be very nice of you to name me as the one with the initial recipe idea. I took some time thinking of it, after all!)
But if you want a fabric port to older versions, I might do it if you ask me to in the comments; suggestions for the netherite ingot replacements for version 14 and 15 are welcome.
